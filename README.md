# Customer-Personality-Analyis
## This project is a part of ineuron.ai internship

Customer Personality Analysis is basically learning the customer behaviour ,purchase and some other static data.

To make the analysis efficiently, we need to do Segmentation using various Unsupervised Machine Learning methods.

Methods like **Agglomerative clutering**,**K-Means** clustering, Density based **DBSCAN** are used in this project.

### What is Customer Segmentation?

  Customer segmentation is done to offer a better relationship with our customers. Not every customer likes the same service,       segmenting your customers will provide them with a better service quality.
